What’s new in this release?

A new visual look! We redesigned the login experience, with a welcome carousel of new content and graphics that promote the app’s features and benefits. You’ll also notice a new colour palette, with an updated app icon to match.

We made accessibility improvements in the block editor for people who use a VoiceOver screen reader. These updates improve your experience with the Columns block.

To help you manage comment activity on your site, there’s now an “Unreplied” filter so you can view all of your unreplied comments under one tab.

We also made other enhancements, including updates to the page layout picker experience.
